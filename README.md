# HeartWave

Computer software for a stand-alone device called HeartWave. HeartWave is based on technology produced by the HeartMath institute, including their Inner Balance and emWave2 line of products.

HeartWave will be able to measure, analyze and display HRV (Heart Rate Variability) patterns through the use of an advanced heart rate monitor and provide users with real-time biofeedback on their coherence levels. The goal of this device is to help users reduce stress and achieve a high state of coherence, an optimal psychophysiological state that reflects well being and health.

This software makes use of the Qt framework and is programmed in C++. The data is generated and the device is in form of a GUI for simulation purposes.
